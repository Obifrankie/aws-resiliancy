Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage

The RTO (Recovery Time Objective) for a single AZ in the project is going to be relatively low because multi AZ was deployed in the project
so as to drastically reduce RTO. So the minimum RTO for a single AZ outage should be between 30mins to 1hour.



Minimum RTO for a single region outage

The RTO (Recovery Time Objective) for a single region is also expected to be verry minimal because multi regioning was a prerequisite for the project
so as to curb RTO when it comes regions.So the minimum RTO for a single region outage should be an 1hour.



Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage

Using AWS point-in-time-recovery we can potentially reduce the RPO of this project.




Minimum RPO for a single region outage

With the help of the read replica database we created in the secondary region we can easilty fault over to a new region to reduce RPO. Although this takes 
into consideration time taken to promote the read replica database and time taken to notice the faulty databse but in all it makes for a much less RPO.
