# Data durability and recovery

In this project i  created highly available solutions to common use cases.  I wilt a Multi-AvailabilityZone, Multi-Region database and showed how to use it in multiple geographically separate AWS regions.  You will also build a website hosting solution that is versioned so that any data destruction and accidents can be quickly and easily undone.

Attached is a folder named project 1 with the screensots of all my solutions
